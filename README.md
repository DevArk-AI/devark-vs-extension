# DevArk

**Ever wonder where your coding time actually goes?**

You finish a session with Cursor or Claude Code. Two hours vanished. What happened? Did you ship something, or did you spiral into a rabbit hole?

DevArk watches your AI coding sessions and tells you what you didn't know about how you work. And as you write prompts, it shows you how to make them clearer for Cursor and Claude Code.

## Co-Pilot: Better Prompts, Better Results

Most developers write prompts, hit enter, and hope for the best. DevArk's Co-Pilot analyzes your prompts in real-time and shows you:

- **What's missing** - Context the AI needs but you didn't provide
- **How to be clearer** - Specific improvements before you hit enter
- **What to do next** - Suggested follow-ups based on where you are

A clearer prompt now saves 20 minutes of back-and-forth later. The Co-Pilot catches the gaps you don't notice.

## Session Insights

After you're done coding, DevArk shows you what happened:

- **Session breakdowns** - What you accomplished, what took longer than expected, what patterns emerge
- **Weekly snapshots** - Which projects got attention, where you got stuck, how your prompting improved over time
- **Focus patterns** - When you stayed on task vs. went exploring

## How It Works

1. Install the extension
2. Code like you normally do
3. Watch the Co-Pilot panel as you write prompts
4. Check session insights after you're done

## Works With

- Cursor
- Claude Code

## Choose Your Setup

DevArk processes everything locally by default. Your code stays on your machine.

| Provider | Setup | Cost |
|----------|-------|------|
| **Ollama** | Local, runs on your machine | Free |
| **Cursor CLI** | Uses your existing subscription | Included |
| **Claude Code CLI** | Uses your existing setup | Included |
| **OpenRouter** | Bring your own key | Pay per use |

## Installation

**VS Code / Cursor:**
```
Ctrl+Shift+X → Search "DevArk" → Install
```

**Command line:**
```
code --install-extension devark.devark
```

## Getting Started

1. Click the DevArk icon in your activity bar
2. The setup wizard connects you to a provider (Ollama recommended for local-only)
3. Start coding - the Co-Pilot activates automatically

## Settings

Search "DevArk" in settings to customize:
- Which provider to use
- Automatic vs. on-demand analysis
- Report frequency

## Tips

**Check your weekly reports**
The patterns you'll notice after a few weeks are genuinely useful. Most developers are surprised by where their time actually goes.

**Pay attention to prompt feedback**
Small improvements in how you communicate with AI compound quickly. A clearer prompt now saves debugging time later.

**Review sessions that felt unproductive**
These often reveal patterns. Maybe certain types of tasks need a different approach. Maybe you're asking for too much at once.
