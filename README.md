# DevArk

**Ever wonder where your coding time actually goes?**

You finish a session with Cursor or Claude Code. Two hours vanished. What happened? Did you ship something, or did you spiral into a rabbit hole?

DevArk watches your AI coding sessions and tells you what you didn't know about how you work. And as you write prompts, it shows you how to make them clearer for Cursor and Claude Code.

## Co-Pilot: Better Prompts, Better Results

Most developers write prompts, hit enter, and hope for the best. DevArk's Co-Pilot analyzes your prompts in real-time and shows you:

- **What's missing** - Context the AI needs but you didn't provide
- **How to be clearer** - Specific improvements before you hit enter
- **What to do next** - Suggested follow-ups based on where you are

A clearer prompt now saves 20 minutes of back-and-forth later. The Co-Pilot catches the gaps you don't notice.

## Session Insights

After you're done coding, DevArk shows you what happened:

- **Session breakdowns** - What you accomplished, what took longer than expected, what patterns emerge
- **Weekly snapshots** - Which projects got attention, where you got stuck, how your prompting improved over time
- **Focus patterns** - When you stayed on task vs. went exploring

## How It Works

1. **Install** the extension and connect to your LLM provider
2. **Code** like you normally do - the Co-Pilot monitors your prompts in real-time
3. **Check daily reports** to see what you accomplished today
4. **Review weekly reports** to spot patterns and improve over time

## Works With

- Cursor
- Claude Code

## Choose Your Setup

DevArk processes everything locally by default. Your code stays on your machine.

| Provider | Setup | Cost |
|----------|-------|------|
| **Ollama** | Local, runs on your machine | Free |
| **Cursor CLI** | Uses your existing subscription | Included |
| **Claude Code CLI** | Uses your existing subscription | Included |
| **OpenRouter** | Bring your own key | Pay per use |

## Installation

**VS Code / Cursor:**
```
Ctrl+Shift+X → Search "DevArk" → Install
```

**Command line:**
```
code --install-extension devark.devark
```

## Tips

**Check your daily report each morning**
See exactly what you shipped yesterday. No more fumbling to remember what you worked on.

**Check your weekly reports**
The patterns you'll notice after a few weeks are genuinely useful. Most developers are surprised by where their time actually goes.

**Pay attention to prompt feedback**
Small improvements in how you communicate with AI compound quickly. A clearer prompt now saves debugging time later.

**Review sessions that felt unproductive**
These often reveal patterns. Maybe certain types of tasks need a different approach. Maybe you're asking for too much at once.
